Thank you for using EpixNet. EpixNet is a collaborative effort of decentralization enthusiasts just like you. We appreciate all users that catch bugs, improve documentation and have good ideas of designing new protocols. Here are a few guidelines we ask you to follow to get started with making your contribution.

### You donâ€™t have to contribute source code

In fact, a majority of contributors do not submit source code. Even if you like to write programs, other types of contribution are also welcomed.

- Do you own a [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/EpixZone/EpixNet#linux-terminal), a [C.H.I.P.](http://127.0.0.1:42222/Blog.EpixNetwork.epix/?Post:94:Running+EpixNet+on+a+$9%C2%A0computer) or an [open router](https://github.com/EpixZone/EpixNet/issues/783)? Try running EpixNet on it and tell us how well EpixNet works on your device.

### Do you like to write code?
